# Formalising Mathematics

This is the repository is a fork of Kevin Buzzard's 2022 course on formalising mathmatics in the Lean theorem prover.

# My Contributions

I added a `applied_math` and `contest math` folder.
The goal is to formalize the basic lemmas and tactics (meta programs) necessary to prove problems typically found in a highschool level math competitions.
